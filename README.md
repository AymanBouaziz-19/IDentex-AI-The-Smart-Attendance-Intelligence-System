## 🚪 How Does It Work?

1. **Smart ID Cards** – Each student is assigned a card with:
   - A **secure QR code & NFC chip**.
   - Embedded metadata (student info, enrolled classes, security checksum).

2. **Hardware Entry Scanner** – Installed at every classroom/entry point:
   - Instantly scans the student’s ID.
   - Authenticates with the central system in milliseconds.
   - Grants classroom access and records attendance.

3. **AI & Data Layer** – In real time:
   - Logs presence, late entries, absences, and class/session details.
   - Identifies **attendance trends, anomalies, and flag patterns**.
   - Calculates **reward points** based on consistency.

4. **Reward System** – Schools can configure:
   - Incentive models: points → certificates, privileges, academic support.
   - Weekly/monthly dashboards for students, parents, and faculty.
